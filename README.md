Example scripts for:

1) R script for extracting gaze from FOVE0, extracting saccades, differentiating fixations and establishing parameters such as gaze area (Bivariate Contour Ellipse Area), fixation duration, saccade amplitude, saccade velocities etc.
   To use: Input csv file directly obtained from FOVE0 raw data (see comments above each set of codes)

2) Python script for analyzing saliency value for each fixation point from result data obtained from 1).
   To use: Input directory in cell 2 and input name of the file and image used for free viewing test in cell 4. If image size is different from 2048 x 1024, change the values on cell 13.
